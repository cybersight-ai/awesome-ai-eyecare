      Traditionally, medical discoveries are made by observing associations, making hypotheses from them and then designing 
      and running experiments to test the hypotheses. However, with medical images, observing and quantifying associations 
      can often be difficult because of the wide variety of features, patterns, colours, values and shapes that are present in 
      real data. Here, we show that deep learning can extract new knowledge from retinal fundus images. Using deep-learning 
      models trained on data from 284,335 patients and validated on two independent datasets of 12,026 and 999 patients, we 
      predicted cardiovascular risk factors not previously thought to be present or quantifiable in retinal images, such as 
      age (mean absolute error within 3.26 years), gender (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.97), 
      smoking status (AUC = 0.71), systolic blood pressure (mean absolute error within 11.23 mmHg) and major adverse cardiac 
      events (AUC = 0.70). We also show that the trained deep-learning models used anatomical features, such as the optic disc 
      or blood vessels, to generate each prediction.

    abstract: >
      Progression to exudative ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (exAMD) is a major cause of visual deterioration. In patients 
      diagnosed with exAMD in one eye, we introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict progression to exAMD in the second 
      eye. By combining models based on three-dimensional (3D) optical coherence tomography images and corresponding automatic tissue maps, 
      our system predicts conversion to exAMD within a clinically actionable 6-month time window, achieving a per-volumetric-scan sensitivity 
      of 80% at 55% specificity, and 34% sensitivity at 90% specificity. This level of performance corresponds to true positives in 78% and 
      41% of individual eyes, and false positives in 56% and 17% of individual eyes at the high sensitivity and high specificity points, 
      respectively. Moreover, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can identify anatomical changes before conversion and high-risk subgroups. 
      This AI system overcomes substantial interobserver variability in expert predictions, performing better than five out of six experts, 
      and demonstrates the potential of using AI to predict disease progression. In individuals diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration 
      in one eye, a deep learning model can predict progression to the ‘wet’, sight-threatening form of the disease in the second eye within a 6-month 
      time frame.
